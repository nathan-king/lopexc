# `lopexc/Driver/`

Purpose: compiler orchestration layer (legacy/alternate entry flow).

## Current contents

- `CompilerDriver.cs`: early pipeline orchestration placeholder.

## Current status

Most execution currently goes through `Program.cs` directly.

## Intended role

Long-term, this folder can host reusable compile APIs separate from CLI concerns.
